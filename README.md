# CandyCrush
This is a GitHub repository of all __historical configs__ for Candy Crush games. Currently, the repository is supporting Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga.
I have also developed an extractor (which is semi-closed source) to analyze each of the thousands-strong levels and config sets of Candy Crush.

The past year I have been mostly away on other private projects, research, and full-time employment. Personal circumstances for me have also been highly unfavorable. It took only until now where I am able to consistently return to full-time activity.

# Timeline
Unfortunately I have been away for quite a while, and only recently came back. An extenuating circumstance happening during the covid years has significantly limited my involvement with Candy Crush Saga. 2020 and 2021 have been especially terrible, as I have to deal with an extenuating family situation. 

# Halloween 2023 Revival
As discussed on Discord, I noticed several significant concerns regarding the current state of the wiki, but this is also due to the booster-heavy nature of modern gameplay progression, the dearth of comments especially for the high levels and episodes, the focus on events rather than on the main map, and the de-emphasis of scoring and story. As a result, to keep the wiki up-to-date, there has to be changes. Same goes for Soda.
