# CandyCrush
This is a GitHub repository of all historical configs for Candy Crush games. Currently, the repository is supporting Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga.
I have also developed an extractor (which is semi-closed source) to analyze each of the thousands-strong levels and config sets of Candy Crush.

The past year I have been mostly away on other private projects, research, and full-time employment. Personal circumstances for me have also been highly unfavorable. It took only until now where I am able to consistently return to full-time activity.

# Timeline
Unfortunately I have been away for quite a while, and only recently came back.

2020 and 2021 have been especially terrible, as I have to deal with an extenuating family situation.
